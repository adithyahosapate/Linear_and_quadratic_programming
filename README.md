# Optimization Methods
Various optimization techniques from scratch

1. Linear Programming using the Simplex algorithm

2. Quadratic Programming 

3. Gradient descent to optimize loss function of an ANN

4. Newtons method to 
   1. optimize loss function of an ANN (Second order optimization)
   2. Find roots of a polynomial. 

The demo.py file in each folder uses an off the shelf library
